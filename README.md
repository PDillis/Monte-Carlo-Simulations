# nnPDE - Solving PDEs and ODEs with Neural Networks

In this repository, we will try to amalgamate most of the known theory for solving PDEs and ODEs with Neural Networks, as well as some example code and implementations. We will start with some definitions, theory, and then move on to the examples when we know the analytical solution, as wel as the cases when we do not.

This is a precursor to my website.
